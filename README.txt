# Tutorials for the Book: From Statistical Physics to Data-Driven Modelling with Applications to Quantitative Biology.

## Repository structure:
This repository contains the 8 tutorials for each chapter of the Book, in separated Directories.
Tutorials are thought to be finished in about 2 hours by master students.
In each Tutorial folder, the material needed for the tutorial is contained in the Data folder (data file and starting Jupyter notebook).
The solution to the Tutorial is given in the main Tutorial folder as a Jupyter notebook.
The notebooks use standard scientific computing packages, that can be obtained for instance through the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
